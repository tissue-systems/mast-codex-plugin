# Sends one message with ack required, then polls the message's state through
# the same channel key until it is acknowledged. The key can read only its own
# channel's messages, so this needs no account and no token.
#
# Exit codes, for the skill that calls this:
#   0  acked     — the human saw it and tapped acknowledge
#   3  resolved  — the human resolved it without acknowledging
#   4  expired   — mast stopped repeating before anyone answered
#   5  timeout   — this script gave up waiting (the page may still be live)
#   6  no channel configured
#   7  the send was refused (the response is printed)
